# brushless-motor-encoder

In this project I utilized brushless DC motor from hard drive as encoder.

In order to do this I used atmega88 microcontroller. 3 ADC pins were connected to 3 phases of motor to read voltages induced on coils while motor spins. Order in which voltages appered determined direction of rotation. Motor rotation was then visualized on LCD display.
